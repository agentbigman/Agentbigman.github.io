title: Simplifying My Life
---

Last week when I was talking to my cousin and his friends about their board exam
results, it hit me that it has been over a decade
since I graduated from high school. Looking back at my life, I realized how
simple it was and how focussed, productive and happy I was. There were no
cellphones, the desktop computer had a slow 64 kbps internet line and no viral
stuff to catch up to.

Planning events used to only involve fixing time and place. Everybody used to
reach on time for that Sunday noon movie show that you planned on Friday morning 
during school hours. Nobody needed any reminders on phones or bloody text
messages. Now, planning an event as simple as a movie show involves tonnes of 
WhatsApp and Facebook messages. You even need to send confirmation messages 
just before the event lest someone is planning of bailing out.

When you wanted to talk to a friend, instead of sending a stupid "Whaddup" on
WhatsApp, you used to get on your bike, go to his place and shout
his name till he gets out of his balcony to say "Wait, I am coming!" or his mom
comes out to scold you. When you saw an exciting wrestling match on TV,
instead of posting a Facebook status or a Tweeting about it, you called your
friend on a landline phone and told him to check out the fight on Start Sports
and discussed "how Undertaker kicked Big Show's a$$" the next day at school.

When you went out for a lunch or dinner or when you were just sitting
with your friends after a match or a class, you used to talk via your
mouths and not through WhatsApp messages. Now, when you hang out with
your friends, everybody looks down at their smartphone screens. When you
went for a trip, instead of clicking pics and posting them on Facebook
with witty one liners, you used to enjoy and experience the scene. When
you went out for a meal, instead of posting stupid food pics, you used
to enjoy the meal. After reading a book or an article, instead of
Tweeting about it, you used to think over it. When you had nothing to
do, instead of staring at your smartphone screen scrolling through your
Twitter timeline, you looked at your surroundings or talked to strangers
or just did nothing. How hard is it to just sit and do nothing without
staring at your smartphone?

When I compare today with my high school days, it feels that I have
become a narcissistic droid. When I see an article or a post, my first
instinct is to share it. I am bombarded with crap disguised as news and
articles in real time. I have way shorter attention span and I can't
focus for long hours. I could read an entire magazine in a single
sitting, and now I can not even read an article without taking multiple
breaks or without switching through multiple tabs on browser. When
someone shares a joke with me, instead of laughing I am like "Meh! I've
read it!".

When engineers see a broken thing, they try to fix it. I too will try to fix my
life and it begins today. I have laid out some rules that I will try to follow.

- I will try not to carry my phone with me all the time. I am not a doctor or a
  fire fighter that requires me to be on call 24x7. Not carrying a phone would also free me from
  staring at my smartphone screen when I am with someone or when I am sitting
  idle.

  I will have to carry a phone diary and rely on public phones. I might
  also start remembering some phone numbers.

- I will use my computer / internet only for creating stuff (except for those
  occassional gaming / movie watching binges).

- I will limit news reading and social networking to once a day. I will prefer
  if someone tells me about viral items (jokes) or I see them in newspapers or TV over
  checking them out on Twitter or Reddit.

- I will use pen / paper instead of apps for simple tasks.

- I will try to call / email my friends instead of sending a stupid "ssup"
  message on Facebook or WhatsApp.

- I will read more books, magazines and newspapers instead of blogs and online
  sites.

As with every idea, this too shall pass the trim, iterate and optimize cycles.
