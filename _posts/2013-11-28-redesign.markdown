It has been over a year since [my last post and the last site
redesign](/archives).
Previous design was based on Bootstrap but the markup felt quite hackish
and I wished to create a clean design template for my blog.

This design is partly copied and partly inspired from [Jekyll's
site](http://jekyllrb.com). The design is responsive and renders nicely
on my Nexus 7 and Nexus 4 devices.

Since my last post, I have joined a gym and started lifting weights,
started investing in equities (made some decent returns), joined
cycling / swimming / running clubs and become a member of library. I
wish I can get disciplined about writing so that I can write about some
of these stuff.
