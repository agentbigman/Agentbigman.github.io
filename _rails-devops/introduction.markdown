As a ruby developer, I have worked on many projects that lacked
dedicated DevOps people and I, like many other devs, was responsible for
setting up of servers and deploying application code. Such exposure has
made me quite comfortable with basic DevOps tasks. Knowing some basic DevOps 
has also helped in deploying my own pet projects pretty quickly.

These guides are a compilation of things I have learned and [some of the
best practices](http://plusbryan.com/my-first-5-minutes-on-a-server-or-essential-security-for-linux-servers) 
and conventions I have found on Internet.

The standard technology stack used in this guide is -

+ Ubuntu 14.04 as server OS
+ Ruby 2.1
+ Rails 4
+ PostgreSQL (& MySQL) as DB server
+ Apache as web server
+ Passenger as application server
