### [Twitter Censor for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-censor/molboeciijkomblejfolkjfeeilgadnm?hl=en)

Browser extension for Google Chrome that lets you censor tweets from
your Twitter timeline. Using this extension you can censor tweets based either on certain keywords
or from certain users.

*Have stopped working on this extension after Twitter launched its own "Mute" functionality!!!*
