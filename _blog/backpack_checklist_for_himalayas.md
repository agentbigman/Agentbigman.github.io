title: Backpacking Checklist For Himalayas

In my recent trip to Uttarakhand, I managed to travel to high altitudes
without getting sick (in all my previous trips to the mountains, I have
felt altitude sickness). The only thing I did wrong was packing
unnecessary items. This list is an optimization based on my experience.

A minimal backpack (for a week long trip) should have,

+ No jeans!
+ Couple of quick dry convertible hiking trousers
+ A quick dry sports track pant
+ A pair of shorts
+ At least one t-shirt for each day
+ One or two full sleeves t-shirts
+ A jacket
+ Socks (ideally a pair for each day)
+ Thermal wear layer if you are going to a really cold place
+ Innerwear
+ A thin towel, a hand towel and few handkercheives
+ A thin fleece comforter or shawl
+ Toileteries
+ Medicines
+ Mixed Dry Fruits - It's best hiking food (100-200 grams for each hiking
  day)
+ Laundry bags and extra polyethene bags
+ A sturdy water bottle
+ A small daypack
+ Floaters / Sandals (optional)

All of this for a week long trip can be easily packed in a 50 litres
backpack and should weigh around 8 kgs including backpack.

**Other Tips**

+ Ranger roll t-shirts to save space.
+ Get proper hiking / trekking shoes. Regular sports shoes aren't good
  for rocky trails.
+ While travelling in jeeps, avoid seats facing sideways. Sitting sideways
  in a fast moving vehicles may induce motion sickness.
+ Take multiple breaks in order to acclimatize yourself to high
  altitude. Break for a tea and a light snack / fruit.
+ Avoid eating too much while travelling. Eat proper meal for dinner
  before sleeping.
+ Watch the water you drink. Unless you are sure of cleanliness, buy
  bottled water.
+ While trekking take breaks at fixed intervals e.g 2 minute rest for
  every 10 minutes of climbing.
