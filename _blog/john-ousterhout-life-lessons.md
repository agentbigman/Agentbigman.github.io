### A little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept

*01/13/2012.  From a lecture by Professor John Ousterhout at Stanford, class CS140*

> Here's today's thought for the weekend.  A little bit of slope makes up for

> So at a mathematical level this is an obvious truism.  You know if you have
> two lines, the red line and the blue line and the red line has a lower
> Y-intercept but a greater slope then eventually the red line will cross the
> blue line.

> And if the Y-axis is something good, depending on your definition of
> something good, then I think most people would pick the red trajectory over
> the blue trajectory (..unless you think you're going to die before you get
> to the crossing point).

> So in a mathematical sense it's kind of obvious.  But I didn't really mean
> in a mathematical sense, I think this is a pretty good guideline for life
> also.  What I mean is that how fast you learn is a lot more important than
> how much you know to begin with.  So in general I say that people emphasize
> too much how much they know and not how fast they're learning.

> That's good news for all of you people because you're in Stanford and that
> means you learn really, really fast.  This is a great advantage for you.
> Now let me give you some examples.  The first example is: you shouldn't be
> afraid to try new things even if you're completely clueless about the area
> you're going into.  No need to be afraid about that.  As long as you learn
> fast you'll catch up and you'll be fine.

> For example I often hear conversations the first week of class where
> somebody will be bemoaning, "Oh so-and-so knows blah-blah-blah, how am I
> ever going to catch up to them?"  Well, if you're one of the people who
> knows blah-blah-blah it's bad news for you because honestly everyone is
> going to catch up really quickly.  Before you know it that advantage is
> going to be gone and if you aren't learning too you're going to be behind.

> Another example is that a lot of people get stuck in ruts in their lives.
> They realize they're in the wrong job for them.  I have the wrong job or the
> wrong spouse or whateverâ€¦

> And they're afraid to go off and try something new.  Often they're worried,
> I'm going to really look bad if I go..

> I'm kidding about the spouse.  But, seriously people will be afraid to try
> some new thing because they're worried they'll look bad or will make a lot
> of rookie mistakes.  But, I say, just go do it and focus on learning.

> Let me take the spouse out of the equation for now.

> Focus on the job.

> Another example is hiring.  Before I came back to academia a couple of years
> ago I was out doing startups.  What I noticed is that when people hire they
> are almost always hire based on experience.  They're looking for somebody's
> resume trying to find the person who has already done the job they want them
> to do three times over.  That's basically hiring based on Y-intercept.

> Personally I don't think that's a very good way to hire.  The people who are
> doing the same thing over and over again often get burnt out and typically
> the reason they're doing the same thing over and over again is they've maxed
> out.  They can't do anything more than that.  And, in fact, typically what
> happens when you level off is you level off slightly above your level of
> competence.  So in fact you're not actually doing the current job all that
> well.

> So what I would always hire on is based on aptitude, not on experience.  You
> know, is this person ready to do the job?  They may never have done it
> before and have no experience in this area, but are they a smart person who
> can figure things out?  Are they a quick learner?  And I've found that's a
> much better way to get really effective people.

> So I think this is a really interesting concept you can apply in a lot of
> different ways.  And the key thing here I think is that slow and steady is
> great.  You don't have to do anything heroic.  You know the difference in
> slopes doesn't have to be that great if you just every day think about
> learning a little bit more and getting a little bit better, lots of small
> steps, its amazing how quickly you can catch up and become a real expert in
> the field.

> I often ask myself: have I learned one new thing today?  Now you guys are
> younger and, you know, your slope is a little bit higher than mine and so
> you can learn 2 or 3 or 4 new things a day.  But if you just think about
> your slope and don't worry about where you start out you'll end up some
> place nice.

> Ok, that's my weekend thought.

### Fear is more dangerous than evil

*1/18/2013. From a lecture by Professor John Ousterhout, Class CS140*

> Last week's thought for the weekend was, a little bit of slope makes up for a
> lot of y-intercept.  This week's thought for the week is, fear is more
> dangerous than evil.

> First of all, maybe I'm an optimist, but I think there aren't many truly evil
> people in the world.  Maybe there are some and they get their fair share of
> publicity.  I think much more damage is caused by people who are afraid.
> This is a much bigger problem I think for society in general.

> Let me give you an example.  People who are afraid will do things that they
> know are wrong.  For example, when people cheat on assignments, in most
> cases, it's when people are up late the night before an assignment is due and
> they get desperate and afraid and made a silly decision to steal somebody
> else's work.  In industry, CEO's are afraid to announce that their company
> had a bad quarter, so they allow their salespeople to report sales from the
> next quarter.  Then in the next quarter, they have to cheat even more and
> eventually it all comes tumbling down.

> When people are afraid, they often behave irrationally because they're
> desperate.  They try things that can't possibly work but they do anyway
> because they're desperate.  That makes them unpredictable and really
> dangerous to be around.

> But at an even simpler level, fear makes people underachieve in all sorts of
> ways and this may be the biggest problem of all.  For example, people are
> afraid to try something new, so they get stuck in a rut doing something they
> know is not right for them.  People might have a really bad relationship or a
> couple of bad relationships and they become so afraid of having another one
> and become so distrustful that they can't form a good relationship anymore.
> They are basically damaged by their fear.

> Or in another example, people are afraid to look bad.  This is often true
> about leaders: you think you have to be invincible, that you're not a good
> leader if you appear to make a mistake.  So, you never admit a mistake to
> look strong.  But if you never admit a mistake, then you don't learn from it.
> If you don't learn from it, you keep making more mistakes, which makes you
> more afraid, causing you to lie more and more and the whole thing just cycles
> on itself.  And if you're a leader, eventually people realize you don't know
> what you're talking about, even though you're pretending everything's
> alright.

> Ironically, the people who sound the most confident and arrogant, I think,
> are often the most afraid.  That arrogance is just a shell they build around
> their fear underneath.  Furthermore, when really evil things happen, fear is
> often closely involved.  If you take sociopathic criminals, these people are
> often motivated by fear, typically the fear of losing control.  They commit
> violent crimes like murder and rape because that's the only way they feel
> they can take and exert control over other people.  It all comes from inner
> fear.

> When evil's carried out in a really large scale--take your favorite
> large-scale evil action, most of the work is done by people who are afraid.
> You have the evil person at the top who scares all the other people into
> doing the really nasty stuff.  So it's the fear that actually did most of the
> damage.

> In general, I think fear is much more pervasive.  It happens at all levels
> and it damages everyone to some degree.  There are certainly times in my life
> where I did the wrong thing because I was afraid.  On the other hand, fear
> does serve a fairly good biological purpose.  Life without fear would
> probably be fairly short.  An animal is about to attack you or a car is about
> to hit you and you're standing on the edge of a cliff--these are good
> occasions to feel fear.  And I think sometimes fear is unavoidable.  With
> stage fright, if you've never given a talk before, you're going to feel fear.
> Or if you take risks and try new things, it'll be scary.  But fear, I think,
> also occurs in many cases that are not constructive and helpful and just
> damages.

> The question is, how are you going to keep fear from damaging your life?
> You're not going to eliminate fear--you might not even want to do that: life
> is pretty dull if you have no fear at all.  A couple of things to think
> about:

> The first one is the red flag approach.  Ask yourself, am I making a decision
> out of fear?  The best way you can tell is if you're running away from
> something instead of running towards something.  Am I doing something because
> I'm afraid of something, not in spite of the fear, but because of the fear?
> If so, you should think about making changes.  Change the decision or change
> the situation.  If you're fighting self constantly, being afraid a car is
> going to run you over, maybe you should be more careful when you walk out
> into the street.  Or change yourself.  Figure out how to get yourself in a
> situation where you're not going to feel as much fear.  I think the most
> important thing is to understand, see what is happening.  If you do that, I
> think you'll figure out a way to help yourself.

> What do you do about fear?  To me, the solution to fear is power.  The
> opposite of fear is confidence and what gives you confidence is power.  This
> is the superman kind of power, not the ability to manipulate and control
> other people, the Stalin kind of power.  The way I think to have a fear-free
> life is to continually be developing skills so you don't feel afraid anymore.
> My single most important strategy when bringing up our kids was to try and
> make our kids self-confident by teaching them lots and lots of skills.  If
> they know how to do a lot of stuff, they'll be confident and live lives
> without fear--that's probably the best way to live a happy life.  So develop
> your powers.

> The third approach is to learn how to harness the fear.  In some cases, it's
> inevitable.  For example, with stage fright, I still get scared when I make
> presentations to a large audience, but I realized that stage fright is an
> amazing natural drug.  The adrenaline rush when you're really scared wakes up
> your whole mind.  I suddenly realize that I'm at my most alert, my best, just
> after I'm scared out of mind for ten seconds with a burst of adrenaline.
> This is an enormous source of power--I have all this adrenaline on my side
> and I didn't even have to take a pill.  So learn how to harness it.

> Overall, I would say, just don't let your life be damaged by fear.  And
> furthermore, not just for yourself, but also for the people around you.  Get
> them to a place where they're not afraid and they can work through fear.  My
> opinion is, if you want a world of peace, you need have a world without fear.
