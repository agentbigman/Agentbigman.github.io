<p class="center"><em>Valley of Flowers</em></p>

During second half of September 2015, I made a trip to [Valley of
Flowers (VoF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_Flowers_National_Park)
and [Hemkund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemkund) with my friends -
[Waseem](https://twitter.com/_waseem), Rai and Vijay. Waseem and I had 
been planning this trip since last one year.

Our entire trip was super awesome and without any unpleasant experience. The
trek and hike to Valley of Flowers and Hemkund is moderately difficult.
This was my first such long distance trek at such high altitude.

Both VoF and Hemkund are insanely beautiful places. In fact, the whole
mountain region of Uttarakhand is serene and its people are one the most
friendliest people I have ever met. And since mobile networks don't work
during most of the trek, you stay totally off-the-grid and your brain
gets a nice reboot. It's worth visiting again and again.

I had planned a 10 day itinerary which included an extra day for handling
any unplanned delays, but we finished the trip in just 9 days. Once can
easily squeeze the trip to seven days as well. This was my rough
itinerary:

**Sept 17th**: I left Vadodara for Delhi via train. My friends joined me
from Delhi.

**Sept 18th**: Spent the day in Delhi with friends shopping stuff needed for
the trip and left for Rishikesh in night via bus. (*The AC bus service
by UP State Transport was surprisingly good*)

**Sept 19th**: We reached Rishikesh at 4am and got a hotel room to sleep
for couple of hours before daybreak. At around 8, we hired a taxi (Sumo)
for Govindghat. Its driver (**Dr. Rathi**) has to be most interesting taxi
driver in the world. While driving, he told stories about him acing
exams in college, getting an MA degree in English and his ex-gf.
Apparently, he knew everybody he met along the way be it taxi drivers,
bus drivers, petrol pump guys, dhaba people or temple priests, and
everyone addressed him as *"Doctor Sahab"*. Everytime he stopped for a
break he smoked a joint. At first, we found
it amusing, but as the roads got riskier, we realized the blunder of
letting him smoke :-/

We reached Govindghat at around 7pm. The route to Govindghat is full of
scenic beauty. The terrain changes every few kilometers. You drive along
a river, then you climb a mountain, then you pass a few landslide zones, 
and then you descend in a valley. All of this repeats many times.

<p class="center">*Enroute Govindghat*</p>

**Sept 20th**: We left for
[Ghangaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghangaria) from Govindghat at
8am. Ghangaria is a small settlement which serves as the base for treks
to VoF and Hemkund. The trek from Govindghat to Ghangaria is ~ 14km, which at places
gets difficult with steep climbs. A well paved path is maintained almost
all along the way. There are a few villages along the way where you can
get food and refreshments.

<p class="center"><em>Enroute Ghangaria</em></p>

The best thing about Himalayas is you don't need to carry a
big water bottle or buy bottled water. You can drink water from any
flowing stream or taps setup by Uttarakhand Government. Its water is probably 
cleaner than that bottled water.

**Sept 21st**: We made Ghangaria base for treks/hikes to VoF and Hemkund. On
21st morning, we began our hike to VoF. Permit for the valley is issued at the
gate of VoF which is around half a kilometer away from Ghangaria.

There is a moderately difficult hike of 3kms from there to Valley. VoF
has to be one of the most beautiful places in India. It's covered with
hundred of species of flowers during July / August. We reached a month
after the flower season and there weren't many flowers to be seen. But even
without flowers, the valley was extremely beautiful.

<p class="center"><em>Start of Valley of Flowers</em></p>

Camping inside valley is not allowed and you need to get back before
sunset.

**Sept 22nd**: On 22nd early morning, we started our trek to Hemkund.
This is a bit steeper than VoF trek. There's a climb of 6000 feet in 6
kms.

<p class="center"><em>Path to Hemkund Sahib</em></p>

You cross a couple of layers of clouds before you reach Hemkund.
Since this is a pilgrim route, there a few shops setup along the path.
It took us around 3 and half hours to reach the top and we managed to
visit Gurudwara Hemkund Sahib just before it closed. If you want to 
visit Gurudwara, then you must leave Ghangaria before 8am. It's also
worth bathing in freezing Hemkund lake which has crystal clear water. 
The hot khichdi served at langar tastes amazing after you bath in freezing water!

**Sept 23rd**: We hiked back to Govindghat from Ghangaria. From
Govindghat we took a bus to Badrinath. There is a hot spring near
Badrinath temple at which there is virtually no crowd during night. We
spent a lot of time that spring which had much better effect than those
sauna baths in gyms. Also, the temple remains open till 9pm, so some of
us managed to visit Badrinath temple as well.

**Sept 24th**: We visited Mana Village which is the last Indian village
on National Highway 58 beyond which lies the Indo-Tibet border area.

<p class="center"><em>Mana Village</em></p>

From Mana, we traveled back to Joshimath, had lunch there, traveled to
Chamoli, took a break, and then traveled to KarnaPrayag. We spent the
night in KarnaPrayag.

**Sept 25th**: We traveled back to Haridwar and then Delhi. I spent the
next day in Delhi and then traveled back to Vadodara on September 27th.

During the trip, everything went as planned and we didn't face any bad
weather. Luckily none us got high altitude sickness as well.

If I were to plan the trip again (which I will), I will rent a bike from
Rishikesh. The road, though a bit risky, looks great for biking. Also, I
will pack extremely light. I packed two pairs of jeans which I never
wore :-/ I also learned about a cloak room in the Gurudwara at
Govindghat while returning; I could have stashed my extra clothes there.

All in all, this was one my best trips and a nice learning experience.
